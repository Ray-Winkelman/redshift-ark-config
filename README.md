#### Ark-In-A-Box Notice (For Server Admins)
A RedShift server instance is deployable by cloning this repository and running `*_Update.bat` followed by `*_Run.bat` with `*` depending on the map of choice. If you replicate the RedShift configuration: *Be sure to give credit where it's due!* 
> Side Note: Don't forget to copy the config files in `/GlobalConfig` to the `/ShooterGame/Saved/Config/WindowsServer` folder downloaded by the `*_Update.bat` script.


## Important Notice
The server goes offline between 2 and 20 minutes to run automated updates and backups everyday at 6:00am (AST). Please be cognisant of the fact that you may be booted, but **will not loose your current game progress**.


## Introduction
The RedShift Ark server rotates and hosts survivors on official maps using the configuration files in this repository. We improve the Ark experience with an interesting combination of popular and supported mods. The map is in PvP mode between 17:30 and 5:30 game time (after dark), and PvE during the day.
